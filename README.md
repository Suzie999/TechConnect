# TechConnect Power BI Dashboard

Some time ago, I received a dataset to prepare a presentation for an interview, and ever since graduating from my data analytics bootcamp, Iâ€™ve been eager to re-work the results into something even more impactful.

To ensure privacy and compliance, I transformed the dataset by changing the industry, objectives, and all references to the original context. This required adapting the analysis to a new scenario, proving the relevance of the insights in a completely different industry.
I prefer to make my Dashboards interactive in order that they can be viewed high-level or in-depth. By clicking on a certain demographic, you will see the rest of the page update accordingly. 
Also, tooltips are a fantastic way of offering more data insights without overloading the report. 
I am still developing and refining my PowerBi Dashboard skills and hope to be experimenting more over the coming months and years.
