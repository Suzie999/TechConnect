# TechConnect Some time ago, I received a dataset to prepare a presentation for an interview, and ever since graduating from my data analytics bootcamp, I’ve been eager to re-work the results into something even more impactful.

To ensure privacy and compliance, I transformed the dataset by changing the industry, objectives, and all references to the original context. This required adapting the analysis to a new scenario, proving the relevance of the insights in a completely different industry.

I’m excited to showcase my second solo Power BI dashboard, which is fully interactive. Viewers can quickly access key results or explore deeper insights by interacting with the visuals.

This project was a valuable opportunity to refine my skills in data extraction, cleaning, SQL, and DAX. I focused on creating a visually appealing, user-friendly dashboard that translates data into actionable insights and meaningful recommendations.
